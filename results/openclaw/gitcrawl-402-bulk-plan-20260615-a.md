# gitcrawl-402-bulk-plan-20260615-a

Repo: openclaw/openclaw

Run: [https://github.com/openclaw/clownfish/actions/runs/28824485477](https://github.com/openclaw/clownfish/actions/runs/28824485477)

Workflow conclusion: success

Worker result: planned

Canonical: #91222

## Summary

Plan-mode classification only. The excluded overlap PR #61443 is already closed and remains historical context. The only remaining open candidate, #91222, is the best live canonical for the narrower Google Vertex retry/stale-ADC recovery scope, but it is not merge-ready because Real behavior proof is failing and merge/fix actions are blocked by the job.

## Impact

| Metric | Count |
| --- | ---: |
| Worker actions | 1 |
| Fix executed | 0 |
| Fix failed | 0 |
| Fix blocked | 0 |
| Applied executions | 0 |
| Apply blocked | 0 |
| Apply skipped | 0 |
| Needs human | 0 |

## Fix Execution Actions

| Action | Status | Target | Branch | Reason |

## Apply Actions

| Target | Action | Status | Classification | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| _None_ |  |  |  |  |

## Apply Audit

| Attempt | Source | Target | Action | Status | Reason |

| _None_ |  |  |  |  |  |

## Worker Action Matrix

| Target | Action | Status | Classification | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| #91222 | keep_canonical | planned | canonical | Only open actionable ref; related to retry reliability but narrower than the closed overlap PR, so keep it as the live canonical for this cluster scope rather than closing or merging it. |

## Needs Human

- none
